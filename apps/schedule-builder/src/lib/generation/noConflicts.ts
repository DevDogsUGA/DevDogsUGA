/**
 * True when a single meeting (paired with the date range of the section it

 *
 * Two meetings conflict iff they share a weekday AND their time-of-day
 * ranges overlap AND their sections' date ranges overlap. All three terms
 * matter: a pair that overlaps in weekday and time but whose terms are
 * disjoint (e.g. a Maymester section vs. a second-summer-session section)
 * does NOT conflict — that date-range term is the fix for the summer
 * scheduling bug, where a weekday+time-only comparison flagged sections
 * that could never actually collide because they never run at the same
 * time of year.
 *
 * Null handling (documented choices, not enforced elsewhere):
 * - A meeting with a `null` `startTime` or `endTime` (an async/TBA meeting
 *   with no fixed slot) occupies no time-of-day slot, so it can never
 *   conflict with anything.
 * - A `null` date range is a should-be-impossible data anomaly (see the
 *   doc comment on `Section.dateRange`) — a failed join, not a real
 *   "no term" case. We fail safe: an unknown date range is treated as
 *   overlapping everything, so a broken join can never silently hide a
 *   real conflict. (The alternative — treating unknown as "never
 *   overlaps" — would let bad data sneak a double-booking past the
 *   engine.)
